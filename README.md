# Intro to Machine learning Assignment 4
## Overview 
This repository contains the implementation of the back-propagation algorithm for training a neural network. 
It focuses on working with the MNIST dataset, which consists of $60,000$,  $28\times 28$ grayscale images.
Each pixel in the images has a value ranging from $0$ to $1$, where $0$ represents white and $1$ represents black.
The optimization problem in this implementation considers a neural network with Rectified Linear Unit (ReLU) activations and utilizes the cross-entropy loss function.
In the python nootbook you can find the implementation of the AlexNet deep convolutional neural network architecture for image classification using PyTorch.
It focuses on training the network on the CIFAR10 dataset.
